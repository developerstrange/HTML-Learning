          Zomato (/zoʊˈmæˈtoʊ/ or /zoʊˈmɑːˈtoʊ/)[2] is an Indian online food ordering and delivery service owned by
          Eternal Limited. Created in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah, it began as a restaurant aggregator,
          providing menu information, user reviews, and recommendations, and expanding to more than 20 countries.[3] In
          2015, Zomato entered the food delivery market in India, which soon after became its core business. As of 2023,
          it provides food delivery and table reservation options in more than 800 Indian cities, and restaurant
          discovery services in the UAE.[4]
