# HTML Learning & Practice Projects

This repository contains my learning journey while exploring **HTML** and basic **CSS**. It includes a collection of folders where I practiced writing HTML code and followed along with a few YouTube tutorials.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `html-basics/` — Contains basic HTML practice files (headings, lists, tables, forms, etc.)
- `html-css-projects/` — Projects made by following YouTube tutorials. Most of the HTML and CSS were copied for learning purposes.
- `mini-templates/` — Sample templates created or tested using copied HTML and CSS.
- Other folders may include small experiments and tests during my learning.

## 🔍 About This Repo

- ✅ Most of the HTML code here was written during hands-on practice sessions.
- 📺 Some complete projects were created by **following YouTube tutorials**, mainly for understanding layout and structure.
- 🎨 CSS styles were mostly **copied** as I’m still learning how styling works.

## 📌 Note

This is a **learning repository**. I’ve used external resources and copied code to better understand web development basics.  
I plan to improve these projects and write my own HTML/CSS from scratch as I gain more confidence.

## 🚀 Goals

- Build original HTML templates
- Learn CSS from scratch and apply custom designs
- Eventually move on to JavaScript and modern web frameworks
