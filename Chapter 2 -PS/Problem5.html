  <h1>Ali</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Ali ibn Abi Talib (Arabic: عَلِيُّ بْن أَبِي طَالِب, romanized: ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib; c. 600 – 661 CE) was the first
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imamate_in_Shia_doctrine">Shia Imam</a>, as well as the fourth Rashidun
    caliph who ruled from 656 CE to 661. He was the cousin and son-in-law of
    the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Born to Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib and Fatima bint Asad, Ali was raised by his
    elder cousin Muhammad and was among the first to accept his teachings.

  <p>
    Ali played a pivotal role in the early years of Islam when Muslims were severely persecuted in Mecca. After
    immigration (hijra) to Medina in 622, Muhammad gave his daughter Fatima to Ali in marriage and swore a pact of
    brotherhood with him. Ali served as Muhammad's secretary and deputy in this period, and was the flag bearer of his
    army. Numerous sayings of Muhammad praise Ali, the most controversial of which was uttered in 632 at the Ghadir
    Khumm, "Whoever I am his mawla, this Ali is his mawla." The interpretation of the polysemous Arabic word mawla is
    disputed: For Shia Muslims, Muhammad thus invested Ali with his religious and political authority, while Sunni
    Muslims view this as a mere statement of friendship and rapport. When Muhammad died in the same year, a group of
    Muslims met in the absence of Ali and appointed Abu Bakr (r. 632–634) as their leader. Ali later relinquished his
    claims to leadership and resigned from public life during the reigns of Abu Bakr and his successor, Umar
    (r. 634–644). Even though his advice was occasionally sought, the conflicts between Ali and the first two caliphs
    are epitomized by his refusal to follow their practices. This refusal cost Ali the caliphate to the benefit of
    Uthman (r. 644–656), who was thus appointed to succeed Umar by the electoral council. Ali was also highly critical
    of Uthman, who was widely accused of nepotism and corruption. Yet Ali also repeatedly mediated between the caliph
    and the provincial dissidents angered by his policies.

    Following Uthman's assassination in June 656, Ali was elected caliph in Medina. He immediately faced two separate
    rebellions, both ostensibly to avenge Uthman: The triumvirate of Talha, Zubayr, both companions of Muhammad, and his
    widow Aisha captured Basra in Iraq but were defeated by Ali in the Battle of the Camel in 656. Elsewhere, Mu'awiya,
    whom Ali had just removed from the governorship of Syria, fought against Ali the inconclusive Battle of Siffin in
    657, which ended in a failed arbitration process that alienated some of Ali's supporters. These formed the
    Kharijites, who later terrorized the public and were crushed by Ali in the Battle of Nahrawan in 658. Ali was
    assassinated in 661 by the Kharijite dissident Ibn Muljam, which paved the way for Mu'awiya to seize power and found
    the dynastic Umayyad Caliphate.

    Ali is revered for his courage, honesty, unbending devotion to Islam, magnanimity, and equal treatment of all
    Muslims. For his admirers, he has thus become the archetype of uncorrupted Islam and pre-Islamic chivalry. Sunni
    Muslims regard him as the last of the rashidun (lit. 'rightly-guided') caliphs, while Shia Muslims venerate him as
    their first imam, that is, the rightful religious and political successor to Muhammad. Ali's place is said to be
    second only to Muhammad in Shia Muslim culture. The shrine of Ali in Najaf, Iraq, is a major destination for Shia
    pilgrimage. The legacy of Ali is collected and studied in numerous books, the most famous of which is Nahj
    al-balagha.

    Birth and early life
    See also: Birthplace of Ali ibn Abi Talib, Early Muslims, and Hadith of warning

    Ali in an illustrated copy of the Turkish epic Siyer-i nebi
    Ali was born in Mecca to Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib and his wife Fatima bint Asad around 600 CE.[2] His date of
    birth is possibly 13 Rajab,[3][4] which is the occasion celebrated annually by Shia Muslims.[5] Ali may have been
    the only person born inside the Ka'ba,[4][3][2] the holiest site of Islam, which is located in Mecca. Ali's father
    was a leading member of the Banu Hashim, a clan within the Meccan tribe of Quraysh.[3] Abu Talib also raised his
    nephew Muhammad after his parents died. Later, when Abu Talib fell into poverty, Ali was taken in at the age of
    about five and raised by Muhammad and his wife Khadija.[4]

    Aged about eleven,[2] Ali was among the first to accept Muhammad's teachings and profess Islam. Ali did so either
    after Khadija or after Khadija and Muhammad's successor, Abu Bakr. While the precise order here is debated among
    Shia and Sunni scholars,[6] the earliest sources place Ali before Abu Bakr.[2] Muhammad's call to Islam in Mecca
    lasted from 610 to 622, during which Ali assiduously supported the small Muslim community, especially the poor.[4]
    Some three years after his first revelation,[7] Muhammad gathered his relatives for a feast, invited them to Islam,
    and asked for their assistance.[8] Aged about fourteen,[8][9] Ali was the only relative there who offered his
    support, after which Muhammad told his guests that Ali was his brother and his successor,[2][8] according to the
    Sunni historian al-Tabari (d. 923). The Shia interpretation of this episode is that Muhammad had already designated
    Ali as his successor.[8][10]

  <h2>
    Companionship of Muhammad
  </h2>
  <p>
    When tipped off about an assassination plot in 622, Muhammad escaped to Yathrib, now known as Medina, but Ali stayed
    behind as his decoy.[4][11] That Ali risked his life for Muhammad is said to be the reason for the revelation of the
    Quranic passage, "But there is also a kind of man who gives his life away to please God."[12][13][3] This emigration
    marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar (AH). Ali too escaped Mecca after returning the goods entrusted to
    Muhammad there.[6] Later in Medina, Muhammad selected Ali as his brother when he paired Muslims for fraternity
    pacts.[14] Around 623–625, Muhammad gave his daughter Fatima to Ali in marriage,[15][16] aged about twenty-two at
    the time.[4] Muhammad had earlier turned down marriage proposals for Fatima by some of his companions, notably, Abu
    Bakr and Umar.[17][16][18]

    <h2>
      Event of the mubahala
    </h2>
  </b>
  <p>
    A Christian envoy from Najran, located in South Arabia, arrived in Medina circa 632 and negotiated a peace treaty
    with Muhammad.[19][20] The envoy also debated with Muhammad the nature of Jesus, human or divine.[21][22] Linked to
    this episode is verse 3:61 of the Quran,[23] which instructs Muhammad to challenge his opponents to mubahala
    (lit. 'mutual cursing'),[24] perhaps when their debate had reached a deadlock.[22] Even though the delegation
    ultimately withdrew from the challenge,[20] Muhammad appeared for the occasion of mubahala, accompanied by Ali, his
    wife Fatima, and their two sons, Hasan and Husayn.[25][14] The inclusion of these four by Muhammad in the mubahala
    ritual, as his witnesses and guarantors,[26][27] likely raised their religious rank within the community.[21][28] If
    the word 'ourselves' in the verse is a reference to Ali and Muhammad, as Shia authors argue, then the former
    naturally enjoys a similar religious authority in the Quran as the latter.[29][30]

  <h2>
    Political career
  </h2>
  </b>
  <p>
    In Medina, Ali acted as Muhammad's secretary and deputy.[31][6] He was also one of the scribes tasked with
    committing the Quran to writing.[4] In 628, Ali wrote down the terms of the Treaty of al-Hudaybiya, the peace treaty
    between Muslims and Meccan pagans. In 630, divine orders pushed Muhammad to replace Abu Bakr with Ali for a key
    Quranic announcement in Mecca,[32][33] according to the canonical Sunni source Sunan al-Nasa'i.[3] Ali also helped
    ensure that the Conquest of Mecca in 630 was bloodless and later destroyed the idols housed in Ka'ba.[4] In 631, Ali
    was sent to preach Islam in Yemen,[4] as a consequence of which the Hamdanids peacefully converted.[11][3] Ali also
    peacefully resolved a blood feud between Muslims and the Banu Jadhima.[3]
