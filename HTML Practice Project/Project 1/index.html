          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> (/ˈʌbdʊl kəˈlɑːm/ ⓘ UB-duul kə-LAHM; 15 October 1931 – 27 July
            2015) was
            an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the president of India from 2002 to 2007.

            Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam studied physics and aerospace
            engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
            Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was
            intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He was
            known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in Pokhran-II nuclear
            tests in 1998, India's second such test after the first test in 1974.
